This was originally done as my final project for Harvard's CS50 course, I have rewritten it in Django and updated it in my portfolio.

My wife decided that coronavirus lockdown was a good time to learn to play Dungeons and Dragons, so I've been learning along with her.
I have made a site that automates attacks, and tracks other crucial information for the user.
The D&D Combat Companion site allows you to register, create characters and enter their level and abilities,
add your characters weapons and attack spells, and use them on the combat page.
The combat page gives you an initiative roll, tracks your hp and death saves (which persist over page reset),
performs saving throws, and has a drop down menu in case you just need to roll a 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, or 20 sided die.
